# 8-Puzzle Game with A* Solver

This project is a simple yet powerful implementation of the classic **8-Puzzle** (3x3 sliding puzzle) game with a graphical interface using **Tkinter**.  
It allows players to shuffle the puzzle, solve it manually, or watch it be solved automatically using the **A\* search algorithm** with **Manhattan Distance** heuristic.
